# How to add citations?

1. Click on the "cite" link
2. As you use Endnote, you will need to export your citations from Endnote to the bibtex format. In the endnote, select all your citations (control A) and then export the citations in bibtex format (bibtex style)
3. Email me the bibtex file and I will add it to the folder here
4. Next type the name of the author whose citation you want to add to the text and then simply add the citation. 
5. 
Please pleae please do not just copy paste endnote citations direclty into Authorea. It breaks everything!!
