Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases and death world wide and within New Zealand.To date, a lot of previous research has been conducted and this suggests that Internet and Cell phone based interventions are effective to achieve cessation of smoking however the effects are short term.The purpose of this Meta Analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of Internet and Cell phone based interventions to achieve longer term cessation of smoking among adolescent and adult smokers.The analysis was based on the assessment of Randomied Controlled Trials whose interventions included Internet and Cellphone components and reported outcomes at six months or longer. Furthermore, this analysis was based on English Language articles published in the previous 10 years and whose comparison group received either any other intervention or an intervention inclusive of but not limited to Internet and Cell phone based interventions delivered at a lower frequency.
Both a Fixed effects and a Random effects Meta Analysis between all studies were conducted to assess the length of abstinence.Morever the individual studies were grouped using an outcome theme and five subgroup analyses were conducted.
Findings from both, the Fixed effects and Random effects analysis suggest great heterogeneity among the studies.Additionally some heterogeneity was found among the five subgroup but overall findings suggest that  Internet and Cell phone based interventions used in smoking cessation are effective in achieving longer term cessation of smoking.
Findings from the subgroup analyses suggest that both Internet and Cell phone based interventions combined with an additional intervention Nicotine Replacement Therapy are most effective in achieving longer term cessation of smoking among adolescent and adult smokers.
