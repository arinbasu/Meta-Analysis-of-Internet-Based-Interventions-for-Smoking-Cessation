# Summary or Abstract of the Thesis

Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases and death world wide and within New Zealand.To date, a lot of previous research has been conducted and this suggests that Internet and Cell phone based interventions are effective to achieve cessation of smoking however the effects are short term.
The purpose of this Meta Analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of of Internet and Cell phone based interventions to achieve longer term cessation of smoking among adolescents and adult smokers.The analysis was based on the assessment of randomized controlled trials which included Internet or Cell phone components in their interventions and reported outcomes at six months or longer.Randomized Controlled Trials were included based on an Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.Furthermore this analysis was based on English Language articles published in the previous 10 years and whose comparison group received either any other intervention or an intervention inclusive of but not limited to Internet and Cell phone based interventions delivered at a lower frequency.Both a Fixed effects and Random effects Meta Analysis was conducted between all studies to assess the length of abstinence. Morever the individual studies were grouped using an outcome theme and five subgroup analyses were conducted.
Findings from both, the Fixed effects and random effects analysis suggest great heterogeneity among the studies.Additionally some heterogeneity was found among the five subgroup but overall findings that  Internet and Cell phone based interventions used in smoking cessation are effective in achieving longer term cessation of smoking.
Findings from the subgroup analyses suggest that both Internet and Cell phone based interventions combined with an additional intervention Nicotine Replacement Therapy are most effective in achieving longer term cssation of smoking among adolescent and adult smokers.
