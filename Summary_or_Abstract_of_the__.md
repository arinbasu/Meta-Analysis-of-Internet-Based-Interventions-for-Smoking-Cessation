## Summary or Abstract of the Thesis

Write here the summary or abstract of your thesis. Write in plain text, do not copy paste directly from Word here. Instead, export the Word document to a plain text file and then copy and paste paragraph by paragraph. This will force you to simplify and read what you are writing and pasting. Please do that. Please do not worry about formatting, as all formatting and refrencing will be done here, nowhere else.
