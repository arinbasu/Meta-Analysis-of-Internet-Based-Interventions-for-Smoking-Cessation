# Chapter 3: Methods

A meta analysis was conducted to measure the effectiveness of Internet and cell phone based interventions for the quitting and prevention of longer term relapse of smoking. The rationale and steps of the meta analysis are prsented below.

## 2.6.1. The Role of this Meta-Analysis
 
A Meta-Analysis was conducted to investigate the role of Internet-and Cell phone-based interventions ‘delivered via email, accessing websites, text messages’ to achieve longer-term cessation of smoking among adult smokers. A Meta-Analysis is referred to as a statistical combination of results from two or more primary studies (Cochrane, 2008). A Meta-Analysis refers to a method that uses statistical techniques to combine results from different studies to obtain a quantitative estimate of the overall effect of a particular intervention on a defined outcome. It is a statistical process for pooling data from many clinical trials to gain a clear conclusion (Medical Dictionary, 2015). 

There are several advantages in conducting a Meta-Analysis. These include achieving an increase in power as power is referred to as the chance of detecting a real effect of statistical significance if it exists, to improve accuracy known as the estimation of intervention effect which can be improved if it is based on more information, to assist in answering questions which are not presented by individual primary studies due to them involving a specific type of participants and specifically defined interventions, this way a selection of studies in which these specific characteristics differ can allow investigation  of the consistency of effect and reasons for the difference in effect estimates, to settle controversies arising from apparently conflicting studies and to generate new hypotheses. For this reason this statistical analysis of findings allows the degree of conflict to be formally assessed and reasons for different results to be explored and quantified.

## Steps of the Meta Analysis

Now write the steps of the meta analysis in clear simple English so that anyone reading this can reproduce your steps. Write under the following headings:

## Study Question

Compared with traditional or all other approaches that do not use the Internet or cell phone based messaging as their primary means, what is the effectiveness of Internet based and cell phone based interventions for longer term smoking cessation among smokers and for longer term quitting?

## Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for Studies
Studies were included in this research if they met the following criteria:

a.The research studied adolescents and adult population aged between 15 and 64 years residing anywhere in the world
b. The research assessed Internet and Cell phone based interventions inclusive of but not limited to access to websites containing information about the dangers of smoking, quitting, relapse prevention, questionnaires, online discussion forums, access to private chat messages, diary, informative and motivational emails and text messages including advice and suggestions about strategies on how to cope with craving situations and interactive voice response. Studies were included if they offered Nicotine Replacement Therapy or Telephone Calls in addition to the Internet and Cell phone.

A study was excluded from this research if:

* The study did not have adults as the participants
* If the study was not reported in English language or a translated version was not available
* ...

**Finish this list**

## Search Terms and Databases Searched
Write here in details what search terms were employed and what databases were searched. How did you know that the search terms you used were good enough?

List all the databases you searched in the following list. 

## Appraisal of the Studies Based on their Titles and Abstracts

This is the first pass of the meta analysis. Write here what did you do to filter studies based on their titles and abstracts. If the title and or the abstract did not match your expectations or did not meet the inclusion criteria for this study then they were removed from further consideration. Write those here. 

## Search for fugitive literature and grey literature

Fugitive literature refers to those studies where the author may have conducted a study but  he did not publish it anywhere. Alternatively, the author may have sent for publication but that did not get published. It is possible to find out about gray literature from trials databases, and occasionally asking experts, etc. Describe what did you do about finding out grey literature in this research.

## Hand searches from the lists of references from the literature reviewed

You need to convince your readers that you did as comprehensive a search as possible. Write here that you rand hand searches following reading the full texts of all studies included in the full text appraisal to look for more studies. So, you searched the University of Canterbury library archives, etc. Write that in details here. 

## Critical Appraisal of the studies included in the full text

Write here how were the full texts of the studies retrieved and what did you do to appraise them critically. There are critical appraisal checklists available. Write how you noted their biases and how you conducted their risk of bias tables. This table will be needed in the results section

## Summarising the Results of the Study: Random effects versus fixed effects meta analysis

First of all, discuss here what is meant by fixed effects versus random effects meta analysis. Then write, what did you do for this particular thesis. Give the equations and steps. State that you used R and Stata for this purpose. Summarising the results of the studies is done by creating Forestlots

A Meta-Analysis uses two models, one is the Fixed-Effects Model and the Random-Effects Model.
In a Fixed-Effects Analysis it is assumed that all included studies share a common true effect size. The observed effects are distributed, with a variance that depends primarily on the sample size of each study. There is only one level of sampling since all studies are sampled from a population with effect size()therefore only one source of sampling error exists within the studies. Since the goal of this approach is to assign more weight to the studies that carry more information, researchers may propose to weight each study by its sample size so that for instance a study with 1000 participants would get ten times the weight of a with only 100 participants. Assignment of weights is applied on the inverse of variance rather than sample size. The inverse variance is roughly proportional to sample sizes but is a more nuanced measure. It also serves to minimize the variance of the combined effect.
The Fixed-Effects Model discussed above starts with the assumption that the true effect is the same in all studies however the assumption may be implausible in some reviews. When the decision is made to incorporate a group of studies in a Meta-Analysis, it is assumed that the studies have enough in common that it makes sense to synthesize the information rather than assume that there is one true effect. There is a distribution of the true effect which can represent effect sizes and the mean of the population. The Random-Effects Model is accounted of two level sampling and two sources of error. Firstly the true effect sizes 0 are distributed with variance 
## Assessment of the heterogeneity of studies

You used I-squared tests. write about that.

## Summarising the Studies: Odds Ratio and Forest PLot

Give the formula for the Odds Ratio, the 95% Confidence Interval and write how you constructed the Forest Plot

## Testing for Publication Bias: visual inspection

Write here that you tested for publication bias by setting up Funnel Plot. Discuss what a funnel plot means and why and how you will use the Funnel Plot to visualise the distribution of studies.

## Subgroup Analysis

Write here that you conducted subgroup analyses following analysis of the entire data set. What were the criteria on the basis of which you selected the sub groups? Write that here.
