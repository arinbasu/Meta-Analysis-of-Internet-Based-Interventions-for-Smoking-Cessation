# Chapter 3: Methods

A meta analysis was conducted to measure the effectiveness of Internet and cell phone based interventions for the quitting and prevention of longer term relapse of smoking. The rationale and steps of the meta analysis are prsented below.

Now write the steps of the meta analysis in clear simple English so that anyone reading this can reproduce your steps. Write under the following headeings:

## Study Question

Compared with traditional or all other approaches that do not use the Internet or cell phone based messaging as their primary means, what is the effectiveness of Internet based and cell phone based interventions for longer term smoking cessation among smokers and for longer term quitting?

## Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for Studies
Studies were included in this reseasrch if they met the following criteria:

1. The research studied adult populations
2. ..
3. 

Finish the list. 


## Steps of the Meta-Analysis

## 2.6.1. The Role of this Meta-Analysis
 
A Meta-Analysis was conducted to investigate the role of Internet-and Cell phone-based interventions ‘delivered via email, accessing websites, text messages’ to achieve longer-term cessation of smoking among adult smokers. A Meta-Analysis is referred to as a statistical combination of results from two or more primary studies (Cochrane, 2008). A Meta-Analysis refers to a method that uses statistical techniques to combine results from different studies to obtain a quantitative estimate of the overall effect of a particular intervention on a defined outcome. It is a statistical process for pooling data from many clinical trials to gain a clear conclusion (Medical Dictionary, 2015). 

There are several advantages in conducting a Meta-Analysis. These include achieving an increase in power as power is referred to as the chance of detecting a real effect of statistical significance if it exists, to improve accuracy known as the estimation of intervention effect which can be improved if it is based on more information, to assist in answering questions which are not presented by individual primary studies due to them involving a specific type of participants and specifically defined interventions, this way a selection of studies in which these specific characteristics differ can allow investigation  of the consistency of effect and reasons for the difference in effect estimates, to settle controversies arising from apparently conflicting studies and to generate new hypotheses. For this reason this statistical analysis of findings allows the degree of conflict to be formally assessed and reasons for different results to be explored and quantified.
