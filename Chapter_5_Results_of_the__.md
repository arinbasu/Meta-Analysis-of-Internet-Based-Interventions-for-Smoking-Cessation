Search Results of Literature

The search results must be accompanied by graphs, tables, and figures Less writing. Start with your quorom chart. 

112 articles were retrieved from the main database search and seven additional articles were identified through other sources. After duplicates were removed, the title and abstract of 96 articles was studied and four articles were gained and discovered using the reference research method. Full text was obtained of 25 articles and seven articles were obtained from a previous search of the literature.  The seven articles which were obtained from a previous search of the literature were used to demonstrate evidence of previous research conducted in smoking cessation. After all fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria after their full texts have been assessed and were further investigated in this Meta-Analysis.

     Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria after their full texts have been assessed.
Three of them inclusive of Borland (2013), Brendryen (2008) and Brendryen (2008) assessed both Internet- and Cell phone-based interventions. Six of them inclusive of Elfeddali (2012), Haug (2011), McKay (2008), Seidman (2010), Wangberg (2011) and Zbikowski (2011) evaluated Internet-based interventions.

Participants
Nine studies Borland (2013), Brendryen (2008), Brendryen (2008*), Elfeddali (2012), Haug (2011), Haug (2013), McKay (2008), Seidman (2010) and Zbikowski (2011) included participants aged 18 years plus, three studies Free (2009), Free (2011) and Wangberg (2011)            included adolescents aged 16 years plus and two studies Rodgers (2005) and Skov-Ettrup (2014) included participants aged 15 years plus. Sample sizes among the studies ranged from 200 participants (Free 2009) to 5800 participants (Free 2011). 


Interventions
Borland (2013), Brendryen (2008) and Brendryen (2008) assessed both Internet- and Cell phone-based interventions whereas Free (2009), Free (2011), Haug (2013), Rodgers (2005) and Skov-Ettrup (2014) included Cell phone-based interventions. Elfeddali (2012), Haug (2011), McKay (2008), Seidman (2010), Wangberg (2011) and Zbikowski (2011) assessed Internet-based interventions. Brendryen (2008) used Nicotine Replacement Therapy additionally and Zbikowski (2011) additional telephone calls.

Outcomes
All fourteen studies inclusive of Borland (2013), Brendryen (2008), Brendryen (2008*), Elfeddali (2012), Free (2011), Free (2009), Haug (2013), Haug (2011), McKay (2008), Rodgers (2005), Seidman (2010), Skov-Ettrup (2014), Wangberg (2011) and Zbikowski (2011) reported abstinence of smoking for at least six months or more after the start of the intervention. For all these studies a seven-day point prevalence self-reported abstinence of smoking was the main outcome. Two of these studies reported a 30-day point prevalence additionally. Elfeddali (2012), Free (2011) and Free (2009) assessed self-reported abstinence and used biochemical verification testing to measure abstinence.

Recruitment
Recruitment was very similar among the studies. Borland (2013), Brendryen (2008), Brendryen (2008), Skov-Ettrup (2014) and Zbikowski (2011) recruited their participants through quit websites and advertisements in online newspapers. Rodgers (2005), Skov-Ettrup (2014) and Zbikowski (2011) got their participants from quitline and cancer societies. Free (2011), Free (2009) used the radio, leaflets and posters for their recruitment. Rogers (2005) put posters up at tertiary institutions within the region. Haug (2013) and Haug (2011) recruited their participants from a rehabilitation centre and Zbikowki (2011) found their participants through referrals from General Practitioners.

An overall Analysis inclusive of a Fixed-effect and a Random-effect Analysis of all fourteen studies was conducted. Previously was decided that if heterogeneity was found among studies, individual subgroup analyses would be conducted to further investigate these results. The details of this are described in the Methods section.
