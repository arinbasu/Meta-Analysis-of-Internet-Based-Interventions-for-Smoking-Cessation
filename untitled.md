# Preface and notes

I have set it up as a template for the Master thesis on the meta analysis of the interventions that are based on Internet to mitigate longer term smoking cessation.

## The way to use this:

1. Double click anywhere on the text chunk and start editing it.
2. You can use a large BibTex database for your citation management.
3. Use simple markdown format to write your paper
4. You can use bold (B), italics (I), write codes (<>), bullet points, numbered lists, quotes, use hyperlinks and three levels of headings.
5. Tables can either be inserted as LaTeX tables (which you may not know how to), or as figures. You can insert figures by clicking figure from the space below the chunk and insert the figure (or table as figure)

## Advantages
* You can see the entire thesis and paper on one page
* We can work simultaneously in the different sections
* Comments can be made aside
* It has version control system so nothing can be lost
* It is easy and time saving
* Very very simple to work with
* All formatting are correctly done and done at the end of writing this
* Very flat learning curve
* References are managed automatically (if you are not sure, I shall show you how)

## Possible Discomforts

* You may not have used anything like this before
* The interface may be unfamiliar
* Need to work on the browser
