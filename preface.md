# Preface and notes

I have set it up as a template for the Master thesis on the meta analysis of the interventions that are based on Internet to mitigate longer term smoking cessation.

## The way to use this:

1. Double click anywhere on the text chunk and start editing it.
2. You can use a large BibTex database for your citation management.
3. Use simple markdown format to write your paper
4. You can use bold (B), italics (I), write codes (<>), bullet points, numbered lists, quotes, use hyperlinks and three levels of headings.
5. Tables can either be inserted as LaTeX tables (which you may not know how to), or as figures. You can insert figures by clicking figure from the space below the chunk and insert the figure (or table as figure)
6. As much as possible, use the text to write your thesis, Please do not change the layout.md file at all. 
7. Write in plain text, and use markdown syntaxes when you write in your own software. Plenty of software other than word will allow you for this sort of writing. Even notepad or onenote will allow you to write in simple text. 
8. Produce all your tables as csv files and we can change from one format to anotehr. You can then copy and paste your files from a spreadsheet format to the webpage. There are several tools here:

* [latex table generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com)
* [Another one here](http://ericwood.org/excel2latex/)

9. All your figures can be in a separate section and then immediately after the figures, you can insert captions and headers. That way everything remains neat. If you want, you can also embed figures within text by using the markdown formats for figures but I'd rather avoid that in a long document. 


## Advantages
* You can see the entire thesis and paper on one page
* We can work simultaneously in the different sections
* Comments can be made aside
* It has version control system so nothing can be lost
* It is easy and time saving
* Very very simple to work with
* All formatting are correctly done and done at the end of writing this
* Very flat learning curve
* References are managed automatically (if you are not sure, I shall show you how)

## Possible Discomforts

* You may not have used anything like this before
* The interface may be unfamiliar
* Need to work on the browser
